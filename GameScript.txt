Script

•	The game starts with the intro screen (Title of the game, then underneath the controls: W,A,S,D to move, then under that is the start button)
•	The game starts like a cutscene where the player, the substitute teacher is in front of the librarian’s desk.
o	    Librarian: You need to learn how to control your students!
o	    Teacher: Can you calm down and tell me what happened ma’am?
o	    Librarian: Well, I noticed that some of the books are missing, and I noticed that one of your students pocketing one of them and darting away!
o	    Teacher: Can you tell me which student it was so I can get it back?
o	    Librarian: Well, I couldn’t really see the child that well, but I know it was one of the books and the only children here currently are your students.
o	    Librarian: And if one of your students could steal one of my books then they all could have stolen them!
o	    Teacher: That’s a bit harsh to say. Could it be that some of them were misplaced?
o	    Librarian: Unlikely! I keep this library in tip top shape!
o	    Teacher *internally*: And yet she can’t notice some of the books are on the floor
o	    Teacher: *Sigh* I will interview each of my students and bring all of the missing books back
o	    Librarian: You better, here is a list of the books that are missing
o	    (After this the cutscene ends and the player is free to move)

Josh & Amalia's original plotlines have been scrapped so they instead will be used to help the player find out evidence for some of the missing books

Amalia: 
    Teacher: Amalia, some of the books have gone missing, may I know where you have been?
    Amalia: Sorry teach, but I’ve been here the whole time reading this book I checked out, see?
    (You look on the back of the cover, noting that the book is indeed stamped with Amalia’s name on it)
    Teacher: Ok then, thank you Amalia.
    Amalia: Jeez, if you want to interrogate anyone with a book, ask that librarian. I haven’t been here long, but she seems really disorganized, maybe some of the books on her desk are the missing books.
    Teacher *internally*: Well she’s not wrong.
    *(Check the Librarian’s desk added to evidence)*

Josh:
    Teacher: Josh some of the books went missing, may I ask if you have seen any of them?
    Josh:...
    Teacher:
    Josh:
    Teacher:
    Josh: Did you seriously forget I’m blind?
    Teacher:………………Yes
    Josh: Well I didn’t SEE any books, but I have heard some stuff falling around the bookshelves, maybe one of the books fell behind them
    Teacher: Thank you, did you remember which bookshelf?
    Josh:……
    Teacher: Oh, right. Sorry.
    (Books have fallen behind bookshelves added to evidence list)
