PROJECT NAME: Library Theft Game

BY Yvette & Mary
MEMBERS: (LIST OF MEMBERS + Candidate Number)

OVERVIEW OF GAME
Think of this like an introduction to your game. What is your game about? What are its key mechanics? What are its main narrative
ideas and themes? What aesthetic choics did you make. 

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Each group member should write their own short section outlining what they contributed
and their process. Explain what it is you contributed, how you went about it, and
what your thought process was. There is no length requirement here, but your section
should be detailed enough that I can easily identify your contributions to the
project.

THEMES
A sentence or two describing the major themes, tone, and ideas of your game.

GAME DESIGN
Discuss the design of your game. What themes does it explore? How are these
expressed through the mechanics? What mechanics have you incorporated into the
prototype and how do you plan to develop them in the final project? Are there any
mechanics you would like to implement but could not at this stage of your project?

NARRATIVE
Discuss the narrative elements of your game and how you plan to develop these in
the final project.

AESTHETIC
Discuss your aesthetic approach and the inspirations you drew from. Upload images
to your repository and point me to the relevant directory for these, and discuss
the choices you made.

ANYTHING YOU'D ADD?
Would you make changes if you had a few more weeks? Or what about if you had a 
full studio behind you? What ideas would you like to implement if you had more
technical knowledge?
